Version 7.48.0 (23 Mar 2016)

Daniel Stenberg (23 Mar 2016)
- RELEASE-NOTES: curl 7.48.0

- THANKS: 15 new contributors from 7.48.0 release

Jay Satiro (23 Mar 2016)
- CURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR.3: Warn about limitations
  
  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/685

Daniel Stenberg (22 Mar 2016)
- Revert "sshserver: remove use of AuthorizedKeysFile2"
  
  It seems we may have some autobuild problems after this commit went
  in. Trying to see if a revert helps to get them back.
  
  This reverts commit 2716350d1f3edc8e929f6ceeee05051090f6d642.

- maketgz: add -j to make dist
  
  ... makes it a lot faster

- libcurl-thread.3: minor nroff format fix

- CURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR.3: minor nroff format fix

- CODE_STYLE: indend example code
  
  ... to make it look nicer in markdown outputa

Jay Satiro (22 Mar 2016)
- build-wolfssl: Update VS properties for wolfSSL v3.9.0
  
  - Do not use wolfSSL's sample user-setting files.
  
  wolfSSL starting in v3.9.0 has added their own sample user settings that
  are applied by default, but we don't use them because we have our own
  settings.
  
  - Do not use wolfSSL's Visual Studio Unicode character setting.
  
  wolfSSL Visual Studio projects use the Unicode character set however our
  settings and options imitate mingw build which does not use the Unicode
  character set. This does not appear to have any effect at the moment but
  better safe than sorry.
  
  
  These changes are backwards compatible with earlier versions.

Steve Holme (22 Mar 2016)
- hostip6: Fixed compilation warnings when verbose strings disabled
  
  warning C4189: 'data': local variable is initialized but not referenced
  
  ...and some minor formatting/spacing changes.

Daniel Stenberg (21 Mar 2016)
- sshserver: remove use of AuthorizedKeysFile2
  
  Support for the (undocumented) AuthorizedKeysFile2 was removed in
  OpenSSH 5.9, released in September 2011
  
  Closes #715

Steve Holme (20 Mar 2016)
- connect/ntlm/http: Fixed compilation warnings when verbose strings disabled
  
  warning C4189: 'data': local variable is initialized but not referenced

- openssl: Fixed compilation warning when /Wall enabled
  
  warning C4706: assignment within conditional expression

- CODE_STYLE: Use boolean conditions
  
  Rather than use TRUE, FALSE, NULL, 0 or != 0 in if/while conditions.
  
  Additionally, corrected some example code to adhere to the recommended
  coding style.

- inet_pton.c: Fixed compilation warnings
  
  warning: conversion to 'unsigned char' from 'int' may alter its value

Steve Holme (19 Mar 2016)
- easy: Minor coding standard and style updates
  
  Following commit c5744340db. Additionally removes the need for a second
  'result code' variable as well.

Jay Satiro (19 Mar 2016)
- easy: Remove poll failure check in easy_transfer
  
  .. because curl_multi_wait can no longer signal poll failure.
  
  follow-up to 77e1726
  
  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/707

Steve Holme (19 Mar 2016)
- build: Added missing Visual Studio filter files for VC10 onwards
  
  As these files don't need to contain references to the source files,
  although typically do, added basic files which only include three
  filters and don't require the project file generator to be modified.
  
  These files allow the source code to be viewed in the Solution Explorer
  in versions of Visual Studio from 2010 onwards in the same manner as
  previous versions did rather than one large view of files.

- ftp/imap/pop3/smtp: Fixed compilation warning when /Wall enabled
  
  warning C4706: assignment within conditional expression

- config-w32.h: Fixed compilation warning when /Wall enabled
  
  warning C4668: 'USE_IPV6' is not defined as a preprocessor macro,
                 replacing with '0' for '#if/#elif'

- imap.c: Fixed compilation warning with /Wall enabled
  
  warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'size' used
  
  Technically this can't happen, as the usage of 'size' is protected by
  'if(parsed)' and 'parsed' is only set after 'size' has been parsed.
  
  Anyway, lets keep the compiler happy.

- KNOWN_BUGS: #93 Issue with CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN in arrays on 32-bit platforms

Daniel Stenberg (18 Mar 2016)
- bump: the coming release is 7.48.0

- configure: use cpp -P when needed
  
  Since gcc 5, the processor output can get split up on multiple lines
  that made the configure script fail to figure out values from
  definitions. The fix is to use cpp -P, and this fix now first checks if
  cpp -P is necessary and then if cpp -P works before it uses that to
  extract defined values.
  
  Fixes #719

Steve Holme (18 Mar 2016)
- formdata.c: Fixed compilation warning
  
  formdata.c:390: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
  
  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is
  32-bits wide in 32-bit land, is being cast to a curl_off_t which is
  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
  
  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
  curl_off_t.
  
  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

  openssl: adapt to API breakage in ERR_remove_thread_state()
  
  The OpenSSL API change that broke this is "Convert ERR_STATE to new
  multi-threading API": openssl commit 8509dcc.
  
  Closes #713

- version: init moved to private name space, added protos

  It would also seem that share.h is not required here either as there
  are no references to the Curl_share structure or functions.

- curl_sasl: Minor code indent fixes

Daniel Stenberg (14 Mar 2016)
- runtests: mention when run event-based

- easy: add check to malloc() when running event-based
  
  ... to allow torture tests then too.

- memdebug: skip logging the limit countdown, fflush when reached

- CODE_STYLE: Space around operators
  
  As just discussed on the mailing list, also document how we prefer

- curl: glob_range: no need to check unsigned variable for negative
  
  cppcheck warned:

  is less than zero.

- CODE_STYLE: add example for indent style as well

- CODE_STYLE: mention braces for functions too

- docs/Makefile.am: include CODE_STYLE in tarball too

- CONTRIBUTE: moved out code style to a separate document

- CODE_STYLE: initial version
  
  Ripped out from CONTRIBUTE into its own document, but also extended from
  there.

- curl_sasl.c: minor code indent fixes

- multi: simplified singlesocket
  
  Since sh_getentry() now checks for invalid sockets itself and by
  narrowing the scope of the remove_sock_from_hash variable.

- multi: introduce sh_getentry() for looking up sockets in the sockhash
  
  Simplify the code by using a single entry that looks for a socket in the
  socket hash. As indicated in #712, the code looked for CURL_SOCKET_BAD
  at some point and that is ineffective/wrong and this makes it easier to
  avoid that.

  warning C4267: 'function': conversion from 'size_t' to 'int',
                 possible loss of data

Daniel Stenberg (10 Mar 2016)
- THANKS-filter: unify Michael König

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 863c5766dd

- ftp: remove a check for NULL(!)
  
  ... as it implies we need to check for that on all the other variable
  references as well (as Coverity otherwise warns us for missing NULL
  checks), and we're alredy making sure that the pointer is never NULL.

- cookies: first n/v pair in Set-Cookie: is the cookie, then parameters
  
  RFC 6265 section 4.1.1 spells out that the first name/value pair in the
  header is the actual cookie name and content, while the following are
  the parameters.
  
  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant
  problems when introducing new cookie parameters, like the suggested new
  cookie priority draft.
  
  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first
  name used that wassn't a known parameter name would be used as the
  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be
  a cookie named 'person' while an RFC 6265 compliant parser should
  consider that to be a cookie named 'Max-Age' with an (unknown) parameter
  'person'.
  
  Fixes #709

- krb5: improved type handling to avoid clang compiler warnings

- url.c: fix clang warning: no newline at end of file

- curl_multi_wait: never return -1 in 'numfds'
  
  Such a return value isn't documented but could still happen, and the
  curl tool code checks for it. It would happen when the underlying
  Curl_poll() function returns an error. Starting now we mask that error
  as a user of curl_multi_wait() would have no way to handle it anyway.

  openssl: remove most BoringSSL #ifdefs.
  
  As of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6980/, almost all of
  BoringSSL #ifdefs in cURL should be unnecessary:
  
  - BoringSSL provides no-op stubs for compatibility which replaces most
    #ifdefs.
  
  - DES_set_odd_parity has been in BoringSSL for nearly a year now. Remove
    the compatibility codepath.
  
  - With a small tweak to an extend_key_56_to_64 call, the NTLM code
    builds fine.
  
  - Switch OCSP-related #ifdefs to the more generally useful
    OPENSSL_NO_OCSP.
  
  The only #ifdefs which remain are Curl_ossl_version and the #undefs to
  work around OpenSSL and wincrypt.h name conflicts. (BoringSSL leaves
  that to the consumer. The in-header workaround makes things sensitive to
  include order.)
  
  This change errs on the side of removing conditionals despite many of
  the restored codepaths being no-ops. (BoringSSL generally adds no-op
  compatibility stubs when possible. OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER #ifdefs are
  bad enough!)

- mbedtls: Fix pinned key return value on fail
  
  - Switch from verifying a pinned public key in a callback during the
  certificate verification to inline after the certificate verification.
  
  The callback method had three problems:
  
  1. If a pinned public key didn't match, CURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH
  was not returned.
  
  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
  verification did not take place as it should.
  
  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
  would not have checked the pinned public key.
  
  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the
  code more complex. Instead we now verify inline after the certificate
  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.

- openssl: improved error detection/reporting

- CURLOPT_RESOLVE.3: minor language polish

- configure: assume IPv6 works when cross-compiled
  
  The configure test uses AC_TRY_RUN to figure out if an ipv6 socket
  works, and testing like that doesn't work for cross-compiles. These days
  IPv6 support is widespread so a blind guess is probably more likely to
  be 'yes' than 'no' now.
  
  Further: anyone who cross-compiles can use configure's --disable-ipv6 to
  explicitly disable IPv6 and that also works for cross-compiles.

  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
  
  Previously, when HTTP/2 is enabled and used, and stream has content
  length known, Curl_read was not called when there was no bytes left to
  read. Because of this, we could not make sure that
  http2_handle_stream_close was called for every stream. Since we use
  http2_handle_stream_close to emit trailer fields, they were
  effectively ignored. This commit changes the code so that Curl_read is

  http2: Support trailer fields
  
  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
  always available.
  
  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
  
  We can deliver trailer field one by one using NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE
  mechanism, but current method is far more simple.
  
  Another possibility is use chunked encoding internally for HTTP/2
  traffic.  I have not tested it, but it could add another overhead.

  rawstr: Speed up Curl_raw_toupper by 40%
  
  Rationale: when starting up a curl-using app, all cookies from the jar
  are checked against each other. This was causing a startup delay in the
  Fifth browser.
  
  All tests pass.
  
  Signed-off-by: Lauri Kasanen <cand@gmx.com>

- http redirects: %-encode bytes outside of ascii range
  
  Apparently there are sites out there that do redirects to URLs they
  provide in plain UTF-8 or similar. Browsers and wget %-encode such
  headers when doing a subsequent request. Now libcurl does too.
  
  Added test 1138 to verify.

  programs that do multipart formposts use curl_formadd() to build this
  list.

- build: Fix support for PKG_CONFIG
  
  - Allow the user to use PKG_CONFIG but not PKGCONFIG.
  
  Background:
  
  Last week in 14d5a86 a change was made to allow the user to set the
  PKGCONFIG variable. Today in 72d99f2 I supplemented that to allow the
  more common PKG_CONFIG as an alternative if PKGCONFIG is not set.
  
  Neither of those changes worked as expected because PKGCONFIG is
  occasionally reset in configure and by the CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG macro.
  Instead in this commit I take the approach that the user may set
  PKG_CONFIG only.

- build: Fix mingw ssl gdi32 order
  
  - If mingw ssl make sure -lgdi32 comes after ssl libs

  gnutls: Support CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD
  
  The gnutls vtls back-end was previously ignoring any password set via
  CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD. Presumably this was because
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file did not support encrypted keys.
  
  gnutls now has a gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2 function that
  does support encrypted keys. Let's determine at compile time whether the
  available gnutls supports this new function. If it does then use it to
  pass the password. If it does not then emit a helpful diagnostic if a
  password is set. This is preferable to the previous behaviour of just
  failing to read the certificate without giving a reason in that case.

- sasl: Only define Curl_sasl_digest_get_pair() when CRYPTO_AUTH enabled
  
  Introduced in commit 59f3f92ba6 this function is only implemented when
  CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH is not defined. As such we shouldn't define
  the function in the header file either.

- sasl: Updated SPN variables and comments for consistency

  "instance" whilst in others it was referred to as "host".

  When the option is used libcurl will use the supplied default.
  
  When the option is not used, libcurl will follow its usual plan of
  guessing from the hostname and falling back to 'http'.

  NTLM: handle auth for only a single request
  
  Currently when the server responds with 401 on NTLM authenticated
  connection (re-used) we consider it to have failed.  However this is
  legitimate and may happen when for example IIS is set configured to
  'authPersistSingleRequest' or when the request goes thru a proxy (with
  'via' header).
  
  Implemented by imploying an additional state once a connection is
  re-used to indicate that if we receive 401 we need to restart
  authentication.

- http: move HTTP/2 cleanup code off http_disconnect()
  
  Otherwise it would never be called for an HTTP/2 connection, which has
  its own disconnect handler.
  
  I spotted this while debugging <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1248389>
  where the http_disconnect() handler was called on an FTP session handle
  causing 'dnf' to crash.  conn->data->req.protop of type (struct FTP *)
  was reinterpreted as type (struct HTTP *) which resulted in SIGSEGV in
  Curl_add_buffer_free() after printing the "Connection cache is full,
  closing the oldest one." message.
  
  A previously working version of libcurl started to crash after it was
  recompiled with the HTTP/2 support despite the HTTP/2 protocol was not
  actually used.  This commit makes it work again although I suspect the
  root cause (reinterpreting session handle data of incompatible protocol)
  still has to be fixed.  Otherwise the same will happen when mixing FTP
  and HTTP/2 connections and exceeding the connection cache limit.

  HTTP: ignore "Content-Encoding: compress"
  
  Currently, libcurl rejects responses with "Content-Encoding: compress"

- SSL: Add an option to disable certificate revocation checks
  
  New tool option --ssl-no-revoke.
  New value CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE for CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS.
  
  Currently this option applies only to WinSSL where we have automatic
  certificate revocation checking by default. According to the
  ssl-compared chart there are other backends that have automatic checking
  (NSS, wolfSSL and DarwinSSL) so we could possibly accommodate them at
  some later point.

  ntlm_wb: Fix theoretical memory leak
  
  Static analysis indicated that my commit 9008f3d564 ("ntlm_wb: Fix
  hard-coded limit on NTLM auth packet size") introduced a potential
  memory leak on an error path, because we forget to free the buffer
  before returning an error.
  
  Fix this.
  
  Although actually, it never happens in practice because we never *get*
  here with state == NTLMSTATE_TYPE1. The state is always zero. That
  might want cleaning up in a separate patch.

- cookie: Fix bug in export if any-domain cookie is present
  
  In 3013bb6 I had changed cookie export to ignore any-domain cookies,
  however the logic I used to do so was incorrect, and would lead to a
  busy loop in the case of exporting a cookie list that contained
  any-domain cookies. The result of that is worse though, because in that
  case the other cookies would not be written resulting in an empty file
  once the application is terminated to stop the busy loop.

  openssl: Fix build with openssl < ~ 0.9.8f
  
  The symbol SSL3_MT_NEWSESSION_TICKET appears to have been introduced at

- FTP: do the HTTP CONNECT for data connection blocking
  
  ** WORK-AROUND **
  
  The introduced non-blocking general behaviour for Curl_proxyCONNECT()
  didn't work for the data connection establishment unless it was very
  fast. The newly introduced function argument makes it operate in a more
  blocking manner, more like it used to work in the past. This blocking
  approach is only used when the FTP data connecting through HTTP proxy.
  
  Blocking like this is bad. A better fix would make it work more
  asynchronously.

- schannel: schannel_recv overhaul
  
  This commit is several drafts squashed together. The changes from each
  draft are noted below. If any changes are similar and possibly
  contradictory the change in the latest draft takes precedence.
  
  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/244
  Reported-by: Chris Araman
  
  %%
  %% Draft 1
  %%
  - return 0 if len == 0. that will have to be documented.
  - continue on and process the caches regardless of raw recv
  - if decrypted data will be returned then set the error code to CURLE_OK
  and return its count
  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection has closed
  (eg nread == 0) then return 0 and CURLE_OK
  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection *hasn't*
  closed then set the error code to CURLE_AGAIN --only if an error code
  isn't already set-- and return -1
  - narrow the Win2k workaround to only Win2k
  
  %%
  %% Draft 2
  %%
  - Trying out a change in flow to handle corner cases.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 3
  %%
  - Back out the lazier decryption change made in draft2.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 4
  %%
  - Some formatting and branching changes
  - Decrypt all encrypted cached data when len == 0
  - Save connection closed state
  - Change special Win2k check to use connection closed state
  
  %%
  %% Draft 5
  %%
  - Default to CURLE_AGAIN in cleanup if an error code wasn't set and the
  connection isn't closed.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 6
  %%
  - Save the last error only if it is an unrecoverable error.
  
  Prior to this I saved the last error state in all cases; unfortunately
  the logic to cover that in all cases would lead to some muddle and I'm
  concerned that could then lead to a bug in the future so I've replaced
  it by only recording an unrecoverable error and that state will persist.
  
  - Do not recurse on renegotiation.
  
  Instead we'll continue on to process any trailing encrypted data
  received during the renegotiation only.
  
  - Move the err checks in cleanup after the check for decrypted data.
  
  In either case decrypted data is always returned but I think it's easier
  to understand when those err checks come after the decrypted data check.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 7
  %%
  - Regardless of len value go directly to cleanup if there is an
  unrecoverable error or a close_notify was already received. Prior to
  this change we only acknowledged those two states if len != 0.
  
  - Fix a bug in connection closed behavior: Set the error state in the
  cleanup, because we don't know for sure it's an error until that time.
  
  - (Related to above) In the case the connection is closed go "greedy"
  with the decryption to make sure all remaining encrypted data has been
  decrypted even if it is not needed at that time by the caller. This is
  necessary because we can only tell if the connection closed gracefully
  (close_notify) once all encrypted data has been decrypted.
  
  - Do not renegotiate when an unrecoverable error is pending.
  
  %%
  %% Draft 8
  %%
  - Don't show 'server closed the connection' info message twice.
  
  - Show an info message if server closed abruptly (missing close_notify).

  schannel: Add support for optional client certificates
  
  Some servers will request a client certificate, but not require one.
  This change allows libcurl to connect to such servers when using
  schannel as its ssl/tls backend. When a server requests a client
  certificate, libcurl will now continue the handshake without one,
  rather than terminating the handshake. The server can then decide
  if that is acceptable or not. Prior to this change, libcurl would
  terminate the handshake, reporting a SEC_I_INCOMPLETE_CREDENTIALS
  error.

  This change is to explicitly specify when we need to read/write text.
  Unfortunately 't' is not part of POSIX fopen so we can't specify it
  directly. Instead we now have FOPEN_READTEXT, FOPEN_WRITETEXT.
  
  Prior to this change we had an issue on Windows if an application that
  uses libcurl overrides the default file mode to binary. The default file
  mode in Windows is normally text mode (translation mode) and that's what
  libcurl expects.

  http2: Copy data passed in Curl_http2_switched into HTTP/2 connection buffer
  
  Previously, after seeing upgrade to HTTP/2, we feed data followed by
  upgrade response headers directly to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() in
  Curl_http2_switched().  But it turns out that passed buffer, mem, is
  part of stream->mem, and callbacks called by
  nghttp2_session_mem_recv() will write stream specific data into
  stream->mem, overwriting input data.  This will corrupt input, and
  most likely frame length error is detected by nghttp2 library.  The
  fix is first copy the passed data to HTTP/2 connection buffer,
  httpc->inbuf, and call nghttp2_session_mem_recv().

- read_callback: move to SessionHandle from connectdata
  
  With many easy handles using the same connection for multiplexing, it is
  important we store and keep the transfer-oriented stuff in the
  SessionHandle so that callbacks and callback data work fine even when
  many easy handles share the same physical connection.

- http2: show stream IDs in decimal
  
  It makes them easier to match output from the nghttpd test server.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  http2: Faster http2 upload
  
  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we
  return NGHTTP2_ERR_DEFERRED, and nghttp2 library removes this stream
  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,
  and upload speed becomes normal.

  Require nghttp2 v1.0.0
  
  This commit requires nghttp2 v1.0.0 to compile, and migrate to v1.0.0,
  and utilize recent version of nghttp2 to simplify the code,
  
  First we use nghttp2_option_set_no_recv_client_magic function to
  detect nghttp2 v1.0.0.  That function only exists since v1.0.0.
  
  Since nghttp2 v0.7.5, nghttp2 ensures header field ordering, and
  validates received header field.  If it found error, RST_STREAM with
  PROTOCOL_ERROR is issued.  Since we require v1.0.0, we can utilize
  this feature to simplify libcurl code.  This commit does this.
  
  Migration from 0.7 series are done based on nghttp2 migration
  document.  For libcurl, we removed the code sending first 24 bytes
  client magic.  It is now done by nghttp2 library.
  on_invalid_frame_recv callback signature changed, and is updated
  accordingly.

- http2: infof length in on_frame_send()

- pipeline: switch some code over to functions
  
  ... to "compartmentalize" a bit and make it easier to change behavior
  when multiplexing is used instead of good old pipelining.

- symbols-in-versions: add CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT

- CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT: added
  
  By setting this option to 1 libcurl will wait for a connection to reveal
  if it is possible to pipeline/multiplex on before it continues.

- Curl_http_readwrite_headers: minor code simplification

- IsPipeliningPossible: fixed for http2

- http2: bump the h2 buffer size to 32K for speed

- http2: remove the stream from the hash in stream_close callback
  
  ... and suddenly things work much better!

- http2: if there is paused data, do not clear the drain field

- http2: rename s/data/pausedata

- http2: "stream %x" in all outputs to make it easier to search for

- http2: Curl_expire() all handles with incoming traffic
  
  ... so that they'll get handled next in the multi loop.

- http2: don't signal settings change for same values

- http2: set default concurrency, fix ConnectionExists for multiplex

- bundles: store no/default/pipeline/multiplex
  
  to allow code to act differently on the situation.
  
  Also added some more info message for the connection re-use function to
  make it clearer when connections are not re-used.

- http2: lazy init header_recvbuf
  
  It makes us use less memory when not doing HTTP/2 and subsequently also
  makes us not have to cleanup HTTP/2 related data when not using HTTP/2!

  http2: Read data left in connection buffer after pause
  
  Previously when we do pause because of out of buffer, we just throw
  away unread data in connection buffer.  This just broke protocol

  issue by remembering how much data read, and in the next iteration, we
  process remaining data.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  http2: Fix streams get stuck
  
  This commit fixes the bug that streams get stuck if stream gets some
  DATA, and stream->closed becomes true at the same time.  Previously,
  in this condition, after we processed DATA, we are going to try to
  read data from underlying transport, but there is no data, and gets
  EAGAIN.  There was no code path to evaludate stream->closed.

- http2: store incoming h2 SETTINGS

- pipeline: move function to pipeline.c and make static
  
  ... as it was only used from there.

- IsPipeliningPossible: http2 can always "pipeline" (multiplex)

- http2: remove debug logging from on_frame_recv

- http2: remove the closed check in http2_recv
  
  With the "drained" functionality we can get here slightly asynchronously
  so the stream have have been closed but there is pending data left to
  read.

- http2: bump the h2 buffer to 8K

- http2: Curl_read should not use the single buffer
  
  ... as it does for pipelining when we're multiplexing, as we need the
  different buffers to store incoming data correctly for all streams.

- http2: more debug outputs

- http2: leave WAITPERFORM when conn is multiplexed
  
  No need to wait for our "spot" like for pipelining

- http2: force "drainage" of streams
  
  ... which is necessary since the socket won't be readable but there is
  data waiting in the buffer.

- http2: move the mem+len pair to the stream struct

- http2: more stream-oriented data, stream ID 0 is for connections

- http2: move lots of state data to the 'stream' struct
  
  ... from the connection struct. The stream one being the 'struct HTTP'
  which is kept in the SessionHandle struct (easy handle).
  
  lookup streams for incoming frames in the stream hash, hashing is based
  on the stream id and we get the SessionHandle for the incoming stream
  that way.

- HTTP: partial start at fixing up hash-lookups on http2 frame receival

- http: a stream hash for h2 multiplexing

- http: a stream hash for h2 multiplexing

- http2: debug log when receiving unexpected stream_id

- http2: move stream_id to the HTTP struct (per-stream)

- Curl_http2_setup: only do it once and enable multiplex on the server
  
  Once we know we are HTTP/2 enabled we know the server can multiplex.

- http: switch on "pipelining" (multiplexing) for HTTP/2 servers
  
  ... and do not blacklist any.

- README.pipelining: removed
  
  All the details mentioned here are better documented in man pages

- Curl_conncache_add_conn: fix memory leak on OOM

- CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS: host = host name + port number

- conncache: keep bundles on host+port bases, not only host names
  
  Previously we counted all connections to a specific host name and that
  would be used for the CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS check for example,
  while servers on different port numbers are normally considered
  different "origins" on the web and should thus be considered different
  hosts.

- bundles: merged into conncache.c
  
  All the existing Curl_bundle* functions were only ever used from within
  the conncache.c file, so I moved them over and made them static (and
  removed the Curl_ prefix).

- hostcache: made all host caches use structs, not pointers
  
  This avoids unnecessary dynamic allocs and as this also removed the last
  users of *hash_alloc() and *hash_destroy(), those two functions are now
  removed.

- multi: converted socket hash into non-allocated struct
  
  avoids extra dynamic allocation

- connection cache: avoid Curl_hash_alloc()
  
  ... by using plain structs instead of pointers for the connection cache,
  we can avoid several dynamic allocations that weren't necessary.
